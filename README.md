# **Description**

Taco Party is a resource to be used when the user is searching for taco recipe ideas. Using an API key, the user is able to either generate a random recipe, or view a list of recipes coupled with nitritional information. The user is also able to look at a selection of salsa and drink recipes.

# **Installation**

# **Usage**

When the user first loads the site, they will be greeted with an animation that covers the screen. To enter, simply click on the animation. The user is then able to either generate a random taco/salsa recipe using the given buttons, or the user can browse various recipes by using the navigation bar. Within the 'Taco' and 'Salsa' pages, the user is able to click on an image to receive a full recipe along with images of each ingredient. On the page labeled 'Beverages', the user is able to either scroll through a collection of alcoholic drink recipes, or they can search for a drink or ingredient. 

# **Technologies Used**

In this site: HTML, CSS, JavaScipt, and the materialize extension were used.
<br>
HTML was used to design the basic layout for the page, and provided div tags with appropriate ID's and classes as holding places for content population.
<br>
CSS was used to style all of the elements contained within the site, as well as add background images.
<br>
JavaScript was used to populate all of the content on the page using two different API's. Also used to define the functions that will randomly generate a taco or salsa recipe depending on what button is clicked. 
<br>
Materialize was used as a substitute for BootStrap, and helped us layout the website, as well as gave code snippets for things like the navigation bar.
